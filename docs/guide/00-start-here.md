# Start here

You have been using AI for coding all semester. One chat, one file, one session, mostly homework-sized problems. **This project is different: multi-session, multi-file, multi-week.** The habits that worked on a one-shot assignment break at this scale — the AI forgets, invents APIs, contradicts yesterday's decisions, and confidently ships code that doesn't run.

This guide is about the habits that don't break.

> **The brief:** ship a scrollytelling personal web page, deployed to GitHub Pages, built from this template.
> **The real lesson:** how to direct an AI coding assistant on a real project — with references, specs, phases, tests, and audits — without losing control of what it writes.

The Next.js stack is the *vehicle*. The process is the *payload*. Frameworks will change; how you direct an AI pair on a codebase larger than a chat window will not. Do the brief honestly and the process will stick.

## Why these habits (what the research actually shows)

The process in this guide is not taste. It's a response to four findings that keep showing up in large-scale empirical studies of AI coding agents in 2025–2026:

- **Agents find the right file and still ship the wrong fix.** On a set of SWE-bench tasks that no frontier agent solves, the agent correctly locates the bug in nearly every case and then patches the wrong architectural layer. The ceiling is *judgment*, not editing skill.
- **Session *shape* beats session *length*.** Successful runs read, reproduce, edit once, then validate. Failed runs tend to edit before they've read — and once a session enters that mode, more steps don't rescue it.
- **Unreviewable PRs don't merge.** In a study of 33,596 agent-authored pull requests, the #1 cause of rejection (38%) was reviewers simply abandoning the PR — not incorrect code. Size and noise kill more changes than bugs do.
- **The model matters more than the scaffold.** Verbose prompts and elaborate frameworks don't rescue weaker models, and they don't add much to stronger ones. What carries is a tight spec and a real test.

Everything in Part 2 — the control loop, the spec/phase split, the exit checks, the audits — is aimed at these four failure modes. If you skip to the methodology later, you'll recognise each habit as a direct response to one of them. Full citations live in [03-working-with-ai.md](03-working-with-ai.md).

## Reading order

The guide is in three parts. **Do Part 1 first**, ship something, then come back for Part 2. Methodology makes more sense after you have felt the work.

### Part 1 — Ship something (feel the work before the theory)

| # | File | Time | Why |
|---|------|------|-----|
| 1 | [01-the-stack.md](01-the-stack.md) | 10 min | What Next.js, React, JSX, and static export actually are |
| 2 | [02-hosting.md](02-hosting.md) | 5 min | GitHub Pages, and why this class uses it |
| 3 | [04-your-assignment.md](04-your-assignment.md) | 10 min | The brief itself — setup, workflow, rubric, how to submit |

**Stop and ship.** Deploy a placeholder version of your site before reading Part 2. You want to have felt at least one real change-build-deploy cycle.

### Part 2 — Why we work this way (read after your first deploy)

| # | File | Time | Why |
|---|------|------|-----|
| 4 | [03-working-with-ai.md](03-working-with-ai.md) | 20 min | **The most important file.** Garden-hose model, failure modes, control loop, tests as durable exit checks, quality audits |
| 5 | [07-prompt-templates.md](07-prompt-templates.md) | 10 min | Copy-pasteable prompts for every step of the control loop |
| 6 | [06-reference-as-context-pack.md](06-reference-as-context-pack.md) | 10 min | How to harvest ideas and working code from real sites into your own specs and phases |
| 7 | [08-a-real-run.md](08-a-real-run.md) | 10 min | One end-to-end run of the loop on a real phase — prompts, loopbacks, and all (template until phase 01 completes) |

### Part 3 — Reference

| # | File | Why |
|---|------|-----|
| 7 | [05-glossary.md](05-glossary.md) | Every term in one place |
| — | [`../specs/`](../specs/) | What the full site is supposed to do (10 short files) |
| — | [`../phases/`](../phases/) | Step-by-step implementation plan (9 phases) |

You do not need Part 3 to submit a basic assignment. It is there if you want to build the full scrollytelling experience end-to-end.

## What you are building (the brief)

A personal scrollytelling web page that:

1. Uses scroll to drive the story — sticky panels, reveals, or scroll-linked animation, whatever fits your topic.
2. Is built from Markdown + React components.
3. Deploys to **your own** GitHub Pages URL.
4. Lists your images automatically at `/images/` — a feature inherited from this template.

## What you are learning (the payload)

- How a modern web framework (Next.js + React) is organised.
- How to deploy a static site to GitHub Pages for free.
- **How to direct an AI pair on a real project across many sessions — using files, not chat, to hold meaning.** This is the transferable skill.

By the end of this project you will have shipped a real, deployed, tested web application using the same planning-and-review discipline software teams use in production: spec-driven development, phased delivery, automated test coverage, and structured code review. The AI is how you scale your output. The discipline is how you stay employable when the AI does the easy 80%.
